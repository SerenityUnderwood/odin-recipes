        <p>Another simple and easy-to-make dish for those who are living alone and don't want meat can 
            this sotbap with possibly another dish to complement your palette. Some of you might be 
            wondering, "What is sotbap?" If you do a quick search on Google, it's basically pot rice--a rice 
            that is cooked and eaten from the same pot.</p>
